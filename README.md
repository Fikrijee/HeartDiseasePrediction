# HeartDiseasePrediction
A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project for predicting heart disease risk factors.
Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations of key risk factors (age, cholesterol, blood pressure)

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression implementations

Optimized Prediction: Fine-tuned Random Forest model with 85%+ accuracy

Web Application: Flask-based interface for real-time predictions

Technical Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Web Framework (Flask)

Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)

Dataset:
Analyzes the Heart Disease dataset containing:

11 clinical features

918 patient records

Key metrics (cholesterol, blood pressure, ECG results)

How to Use:
Run EDA notebooks to explore risk factors

Train models using model_training.py

Launch Flask app for predictions: flask run
